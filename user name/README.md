# Username Verification Program

## Description
This Python program accepts a username from the user and verifies if the entered username is correct. It follows a simple plan:
1. Name Entry: The user is prompted to enter their name.
2. Empty Check: If the user forgets to enter their name, the program will ask again.
3. Confirmation: Once a name is entered, the program asks for confirmation. If the user confirms the name with 'yes', the program prints "Complete!". Otherwise, it prompts the user to enter their correct name again.

## Usage
1. Run the program using a Python interpreter.
2. Follow the on-screen prompts to enter and confirm your username.
